             <h1>Trevor Noah</h1><br>

                <p>" Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime is a funny and touching memoir about growing 
                    up mixed-race in apartheid South Africa, where his very existence was illegal. 
                    Raised by his fearless, religious mother, Trevor shares wild and sometimes 
                    heartbreaking stories—from being hidden as a child to navigating poverty, 
                    racism, and violence, all while using humor to survive. The book highlights 
                    his struggles with identity, his mother’s incredible influence, and his journey 
                    from an outcast kid to a successful comedian, showing how resilience and laughter 
                    can overcome even the toughest challenges. "</p>

                <h1>Unbelonging</h1>
                <p> Trevor Noah's book Is  a story of many african people, who faced different challenges
                     during the aparthied time.And 
                    I renamed the title based on my reflection from the book and I called It <em>Unbelonging.</em> unbelonging captures the essence of Trevor Noah’s<br>
                    experience growing up mixed-race in apartheid and post-apartheid<br> South Africa.
                    Under appartied noah's existence as a mixed race child was <br>totally illegal and
                    made him to felt unbelonginess.He was like an outsider <br>in school,social life(too black
                    to be accepted by white south african,too white to <br>be accepted by black african and
                    not quit fitting the coloured identity either)<br>,even the ability to speak
                    multilanguage made him to be an outsider ,<br>always adapting but never fully rooted.

                <blockquote>
                    " Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."
                </blockquote><br>

                This quote irritated me when it comes to gender roles. Abel, in theory, desires a woman who conforms
                to traditional
                expectations, someone subservient and obedient. However, his heart betrays him; he's drawn to women
                with independent
                spirits, women who refuse to be confined. The tragic irony is that Abel, driven by his own
                insecurities or desire for
                control, ultimately seeks to "cage" the very freedom he admires.
                Many men claim to want an "independent " woman-educated,ambitions,outspoken but still expect her to
                shrink herself in
                private.for example a boyfriend praises his girlfriends career success but sulks when she works late
                but tradition
                doesn't mean oppression.Like patricia,breaking free from these cages isn't just rebellion;it's
                survival.
                This quote can resonate with girls and women for several reasons:

                <p> -Recognition of a Familiar Pattern: Many women have encountered men, or know of men, who express a
                    desire for a "traditional" partner while simultaneously being drawn to women who are independent and
                    strong. </p>
                <p> - Fear of Being "Caged": The phrase "put her in a cage" evokes a strong emotional response. It
                    speaks to the fear of losing one's autonomy, freedom, and sense of self within a relationship. Women
                    who value their independence might find this prospect particularly alarming, as it represents a
                    potential loss of control over their own lives.</p>
                <p> -Warning Sign Recognition: The quote can serve as a warning sign, alerting women to be wary of
                    partners who express a desire for a "traditional" wife while exhibiting controlling tendencies. It
                    encourages women to be vigilant and protect their independence within relationships</p>
                <p> -Awareness of Double Standards: The quote exposes a double standard: the expectation that women
                    should be both independent and subservient. It highlights the pressure women face to conform to
                    conflicting ideals, often leading to a sense of being "damned if you do, damned if you don't.</p>
